# Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 Solutions

For the [Aberdeen Python User Group](https://pythonaberdeen.github.io) November 2024 event, I came up with three 2-part puzzles inspired by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

View my Puzzles here: [Lee A. Christie — APUG Nov 2024](https://leechristie.com/xmas24)

The answers for the puzzles are:

| Puzzle                        |  Part 1 |  Part 2 |
| :---------------------------- | ------: | ------: |
| Puzzle 1 — Elf Age Conundrum  |     397 |     249 |
| Puzzle 2 — Seagulls and Chips |     145 |   16.46 |
| Puzzle 3 — Presents go Pop!   | 4738.61 | 4855.08 |

This repo contains my sample solutions for each part.

- [Puzzle 2 — Seagulls and Chips (Sample Solution)](solution2.ipynb)
- [Puzzle 3 — Presents go Pop! (Sample Solution)](solution3.ipynb)

For convenience, copies of the three input files are also included in this repo, although they are still available on the puzzle description on my website.
